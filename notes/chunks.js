Answer
To set up chunks specifically for separating an admin section with server-side authentication, you can follow these steps:
Define the admin chunk in your Vite configuration:
javascript
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    rollupOptions: {
      output: {
        manualChunks: {
          admin: ['./src/admin/index.js'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
Use dynamic imports for admin components:
javascript
const AdminDashboard = () => import('./components/AdminDashboard.vue')
const AdminSettings = () => import('./components/AdminSettings.vue')
Implement server-side authentication checks:
javascript
// In your server-side routing logic
app.get('/admin/*', (req, res, next) => {
  if (isAuthenticated(req)) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.redirect('/login');
  }
});
Use dynamic imports within authenticated routes:
javascript
// In your Vue router configuration
const router = new VueRouter({
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/admin',
      component: () => import('./views/Admin.vue'),
      beforeEnter: (to, from, next) => {
        checkServerAuth().then(isAuth => {
          if (isAuth) {
            next();
          } else {
            next('/login');
          }
        });
      },
      children: [
        { 
          path: 'dashboard', 
          component: () => import('./components/AdminDashboard.vue')
        },
        { 
          path: 'settings', 
          component: () => import('./components/AdminSettings.vue')
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});
This setup ensures that:
Admin-related code is bundled into a separate chunk.
The admin chunk is only loaded after successful server-side authentication.
Unauthenticated users cannot access the HTML of admin components, as they are dynamically imported only after authentication.
By implementing these measures, you create a secure admin section where the HTML for admin pages is only served to authenticated users, effectively preventing unauthorized access to admin content12

What does the file referenced here look like? admin: ['./src/admin/index.js'],
Sources
Answer
The file './src/admin/index.js' is typically used as an entry point for the admin-related code in a Vite project. While the exact contents of this file are not provided in the search results, it would likely contain the following elements:
Imports of admin-specific components, views, and utilities.
Initialization of admin-related features or modules.
Exports of admin components or functions to be used in the main application.
Here is an example of what this file might look like:
javascript
// src/admin/index.js

import AdminDashboard from './components/AdminDashboard.vue'
import AdminSettings from './components/AdminSettings.vue'
import AdminUsers from './components/AdminUsers.vue'

// Initialize admin-specific services or state management
import { initAdminServices } from './services/adminServices'

initAdminServices()

// Export admin components and utilities
export {
  AdminDashboard,
  AdminSettings,
  AdminUsers
}

// Export any admin-specific utilities or helpers
export { adminUtils } from './utils/adminUtils'
This file serves as the main entry point for the admin chunk, allowing Vite to bundle all admin-related code separately from the main application code1
